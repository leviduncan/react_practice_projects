      "question": "How do you use accordion components?",
      "answer": "To use accordion components, you'll need to pull the bellows and press the buttons and keyboards based on your notes of choice. The bellows direct the sound, touch, and dynamics, while the keyboards and buttons are responsible for the pitch level. You can also use the air button and the treble and bass switches to control the sound. And if you're feeling adventurous, you can even try playing the accordion upside down!"

      "question": "What's a fun fact about accordion components?",
      "answer": "Did you know that the accordion was inspired by the Chinese musical instrument, the Sheng? The Sheng has a mouthpiece, resonator box, bamboo pipes, and a wind chamber, and is reminiscent of the accordion's vibrating reed tones. That being so, the introduction of the accordion came about in 1829, when Cyril Demian patented the instrument, coining the term, 'akkordeon.'"
